# TrendHive Sales Analysis
An analysis of TrendHive (a fast growing retail company) sales data. This project explores the sale, customer, and store data to generate actionable insights to make logical business decisions.

## Project Overview
TrendHive, a fast growing retail brand with multiple store in different locations across the globe is experiencing some inconsitencies in sales performance, delivery effectiveness across multiple stores. Some stores are doing greatly, while some other are underperforming. Some products sell more quickly, while other remain unsold for a long time.
I was brought in as a data analyst to address this. My task is to analyse internal data which include historical sales, customer information, store metrics, and product details.
The goal of this project is to optimize inventory, refine marketing, enhance logistics, and improve the overall customer experience through data-driven strategies.
